# Feed Reader Testing

For this project I have to test the features of this web-based application that reads RSS feeds, with the help of [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).

## Getting started

### Local installation

1. install a local web-server, I use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
  * `npm install http-server` to install this package globally
2. clone or download this project repo [https://github.com/guglio/Neighborhood-Map.git](https://github.com/guglio/Neighborhood-Map.git)
3. launch the web-server
  . If you use `http-server`:
    1. `open terminal`
    2. `cd <PATH>/Neighborhood-Map/`
    3. `http-server`
    4. open browser and enter `http://localhost:8080`
    5. Done! :)
4. open browser and enter `http://localhost/`

### feedreader.js - Spec file

Inside this file (located in `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`) there are all the different tests that runs against the application.
Inside this file, I added lots of comments to read through the code
